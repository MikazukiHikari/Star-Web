        on Mount Ida, Ganymede was spotted by Zeus. The king of gods fell in love with him and flew down to the mountain in the form of a large bird, whisking Ganymede away to the heavens. Ever since, the boy has served as cupbearer to the gods. Ovid
        has Orpheus sing the tale.</p>

      <p class="normaltext">Aries is the first astrological sign in the zodiac, spanning the first 30 degrees of celestial longitude (0°≤ λ ≤30°), and originates from

	  exactly the first month of the Solar Hijri calendar (Arabic Hamal/Persian Farvardin/Wray).</p>
	  <p class="normaltext">According to the tropical system of astrology, the Sun enters the sign of Aries when it reaches the March equinox, which occurs on average on 
	  March 21 (by design). Because the Earth takes approximately 365.24 days to go around the Sun, the precise time of the equinox is not the same each year, and generally 
	  will occur about six hours later from one year to the next until reset by a leap year. February 29 of a leap year causes that year's vernal equinox to fall about
	  eighteen hours earlier—according to the calendar—compared with the previous year. From 1800 to 2050 inclusive the vernal equinox date has (or will) range(d) from March 
	  19 at 22:34 UT1 in 2048 to March 21 at 19:15 UT1 in 1903.Under the sidereal zodiac, the sun approximately transits Aries from April 15 to May 14.</p>
