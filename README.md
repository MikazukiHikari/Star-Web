## Topic
To open the web, please download the coding file and open the star.html with browser  
This project designs a webpage for viewing various horoscopes. Here, users can observe the specific information about each horoscope in a scientific manner, such as when they appear in the sky and their ancient myths.  
The design emphasizes beautiful starry sky backgrounds. Users can click on stars to enter specific constellations, and hovering over stars causes them to twinkle and display their constellation name. The transitions between screens are accompanied by a rocket launch animation, aiming to provide readers with a delightful experience.
